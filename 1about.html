                <p> <span class="first_letter">S</span>o, you've decided to learn a little bit more about me.</p>
                <p>I'm 21 years old. A business student majoring in Finance and Marketing at The University of Western Australia. I partake in numerous trades, adept at a few but ultimately a master of none. Basically, I do alot of things but still <i>suck</i>. I spend alot of time on social media where my interests range from memes to quality thought provoking think-pieces; all by strangers from the internet (I love twitter). Recently, I've been fostering a growing interest in digital communications, marketing, and product development and hope to build a career in these fields. </p>

                <h4>Why did you start this website?</h4>
                <p><span class="first_letter">A</span> fairly recent turn of events in my life has pushed me to seek mental growth, constant improvement in my abilities and skills, and self-awareness which will hopefully lead to success in my professional and personal life. Cheesy as it is, it is what it is. All of which will be documented on this site, or Microsoft Word and local website files on my computer that will never see the light of day.</p>           
                <p>This site would be used to upload the products of the skills I would like to learn (e.g. Video editing, creative writing, HTML, Javascript, and CSS skills) that may be useful for when I enter the workforce.
                Just as important is that this would be an outlet for my creative juices to flow. Though it may sound like rambling, perhaps maybe the content I put out sheds some perspective on things you may relate to. These will mostly manifest in the form of writing for now, and into blogs and vlogs the moment I muster up the courage to show my face on camera.</p>               
                <p>And <i>just as important as how what I just said is important</i> is that I publish what I do just for the fun of it; it's not that serious after all.</p>
                <hr class="separator">
                <h4>What do you ultimately aim to achieve with this website?</h4>
                <p><span class="first_letter">I</span> want my thoughts and ideas to be immortalized. I want to write about the products of my experiences whether it be lessons to myself or thoughts conjured from deep thought<i> (also probably muddled within are the publishes purely for my own amusement).</i> To me, think-pieces in the form of writing  gives it a sense of legitimacy; just as the act of writing down goals do. I'd want this site to document my progress; where I can come back and see how far I've come from the quality of content and the technical functions of the site. And what better way to have it procured and presented in a way where I get to work on my writing ability and web development skills at the same time? But ultimately, I'd want you, my viewers, to have a takeaway from the the publishes just as I have. I hope that it would offer insight, comfort, or help in any way at all.</p><p style="text-align: center;">Also, this would give me the satisfaction of actually doing something productive!</p>
