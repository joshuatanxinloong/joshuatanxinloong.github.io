        <p> <span class="first_letter">B</span>ulbasaur is designated Pokemon #001. Yes, Bulbasaur is first in line of an ever-growing list (as of now, 809 strong) of creatures of mind-boggling variations that are stored in tiny baseball-sized capsules and only summoned when pitted against other creatures to use their powers and abilities in a fight to the <i>death</i>; all for, but not limited to, monetary gain, <i>fun</i>, or a stupid badge. Oh, did I mention that these creatures are held against their own will and are doomed to fight in these overglorified dogfights for eternity?</p>

        <p>So, why Bulbasaur? I too am not sure my friend. I guess what I'm saying is that the Bulbasaur is symbolic to this first post in a way that it signifies the first in a long line of many that will touch the hearts of people of all ages, make a positive impact on the world, and create meaningful experiences just as the Pokemon franchise has done. <i>That's right</i>, this is my first post and there will be many more.</p>

        <p>Yea, that pep talk is all fine and dandy, but I haven't been on this site since March. What have I been up to then? Indulging in books like I said I would? Developing and growing myself as a person? Perhaps actually doing the things that I <i>explicitly </i>jotted down as goals with actual deadlines I was supposed to follow?<i>Nope</i> Haven't been doing much lately. Been caught up in school work and other <i>dumb</i> shenanigans.</p>
        <p>And yes. 0, I say 0. Nil. Nada. None. <i>Nothing</i> has been uploaded to the media section prior to this post. But will an empty media section define my self-worth as a creative? Does it mean I dont have anything working behind the scenes? The answer is... <i>yes.</i> I absolutely don't have anything to show for. Does that mean I have given up on the purpose of this site? Should I just add this to the long list of goals I set myself out to achieve but always come up short of? Should I just burn everything I own and live a nomadic life travelling around the world where success in the context of this era's capitalist society is of no priority? ...ye- <i>*slaps self*</i> No. It's like I said. I've just been real busy with schoolwork and a recent school event I helped organize. <i>"Oh, what about video editing? Did you work on that?"</i> LOL no. I don't even have a camera to begin with. Anyways thats about it. It is by God's divine grace that the second media post would be uploaded.

        <p>But everybody's gotta start somewhere right? This post is bad, the first always is; like Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur constantly ranks the lowest in preference when it comes to Kanto starter selection. Yes, Bulbasaur serves an early advantage against early gym leaders like Misty and Brock but-</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Let's not get carried away.</p>
        <p>Anyway, Hope you liked the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">diary entry</span> captain's log. Hope you'll come back and visit soon!</p>
