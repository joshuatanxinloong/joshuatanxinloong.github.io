        <p style="text-align: center"><i><span class="first_letter">T</span>he LEGO Group and Bricklink… now kiss…</i></p>
        <p>On the 26th of November it was announced that The LEGO Group would be acquiring BrickLink, an online secondary marketplace for used and new individual LEGO parts and sets. It’s basically eBay with extra features and a vibrant community - but sadly no <i><a href="https://crazythingssoldonebay.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-08-at-3-43-14-pm.png?w=1200" id="hreflink1">Dorito shaped like the Pope’s hat.</a></i></p>
        <p>Oh, and BrickLink has a digital building studio. Pretty neat. </p>
        <p>In an interview conducted by Brickset, the CMO of The LEGO Group assured that there would be <i>no immediate changes to the site (remember that, it’s important)</i> citing that prices, price setting mechanics, and the value of existing offers will be unchanged to maintain the competitive robustness of the marketplace - <i>yeah, right</i>. With this, she also assured that the group would have little involvement in marketplace operations - <i>yeah, right (again)</i>. Oh, I love LEGO as much as the next kid using his teeth to separate bricks and the next guy crying over the catastrophic reboot of Bionicle <i>(it’s me, I’m the next guy)</i>, but I’m trying to come up with objective implications of this acquisition. </p>
        
        <h4>A Channel to Market</h4>
        
        <p>As quoted in the press release, the main premise of the deal is to “provide the LEGO Group with a unique opportunity to connect with adult fans through new channels and exciting experiences”. Taken at face value, it seems that LEGO hopes to build relationships with adult fans of LEGO (abbreviated as AFOL) and enhance the LEGO experience - don’t take my word for it but I think this was mentioned in the interview at least a hundred times. After all, it’s hard to believe that LEGO saw BrickLink as another significant source of revenue.</p>
        
        <p>This is one of the main reasons I stand behind the acquisition of the marketplace: LEGO recognizes the significance of it’s adult fan base and has taken steps in the right direction to serve them more effectively. So you know what that means boys - If I’m right, we’ll probably see more themes targeted at older audiences. Personally I’ve been waiting for something like this, my heart died a little when I learned that Trolls were being introduced in 2020 instead of a much needed - <i>oh God please don’t mess this up</i> - third Bionicle reboot with an actually plausible storyline and systematic builds <i>(none of that Hero Factory stuff)</i>.</p>
        
        <p>LEGO now has a direct communication channel to market products to its’ older fans. This is nothing new as BrickLink has collaborated with LEGO on several occasions to do this. Direct communication would also allow the company to monitor and have a deeper understanding of the demands and desires of the AFOL. The best part is that LEGO is <i>now actually able to act on the qualitative information gathered and strategize for BrickLink accordingly</i>. With Bricklink having 10,000 stores registered on the marketplace from 70 countries, and buyers all over the world, LEGO could leverage Bricklink’s global reach to enact the same strategy of communication and promotion on a global scale.</p>
        
        <h4>Control</h4>
        
        <p>BrickLink is the main hub for the secondary market of LEGO items. The acquisition will allow for substantial control over third-party sellers operating on the site, but what’s more interesting is the inevitable action that will be taken to <i>control the third-party parts market in the marketplace</i>.</p>
        
        <h5>Third-Party Sellers</h5>
        
        <p>My Own Creations (MOCs) are the lifeblood of the AFOL community - a simple YouTube search of any LEGO convention will tell you that. I’m 22 years old and I still piss myself looking at World War II dioramas and Imperial Destroyers the size of a dinner table.

        <figcaption class="figcaption"><i>You see what I mean?</i></figcaption>
        </div>
        
        <div class="articleparagraphswrapper">
        <p>BrickLink could potentially provide LEGO with a direct-to-consumer channel for individual or bulk purchases of parts or even whole sets to build custom creations. Yep, that puts third-party sellers in <i>direct competition</i> with the company whose products they are selling on the marketplace - <i>LEGO itself</i>. This could be facilitated by BrickLink’s digital building studio whereby buyers can select exactly what parts and quantity to purchase directly from LEGO. </p>

        <p>LEGO could also possibly limit or completely remove listings of recent or specific products - consolidating sales to LEGO from third-parties. Yea, that kind of sucks. Some sets are available at different release dates according to region, so third party sellers who list sets that are not globally available may see their listings removed. </p>

        <p>All this speculation is all fine and dandy, but the fact is that LEGO has the <i>power to alter and dictate the offerings available on the marketplace</i>. </p>
        
        <h5>Third-Party Parts</h5>
        
        <p>LEGO easily could pull something out of Thanos’ rulebook and at the snap of a finger, eliminate all third-party parts listings on the marketplace. This will definitely curb competition, but I personally feel that it’s hard to believe that this was the main, underlying reason for the acquisition. Firstly, a vast majority of bootleg LEGO sets, namely the most popular of them all - LEPIN, are sold <i>outside</i> of BrickLink, and are usually only available online in the western world. Secondly, the majority of third-party manufacturers on BrickLink are relatively smaller and don’t manufacture at the scale to put a significant dent in the group’s market share - collectively and  individually. This lack of scale also contributes to the already inflated costs of manufacturing small, individual, unique parts - it’s hard to believe that third-party sellers on BrickLink are able to compete with LEGO on the basis of price. Heck, LEGO is a monopoly in the market for bricks and blocks, with competitors such as Mega Construx needing to rely mainly on licensed themes to set themselves apart. However, being a monopoly does not mean that the threat of competition from the third-party parts and sets market can be ignored and allowed to grow.</p>

        <p>More importantly, third-party parts listed on BrickLink fulfil a specific niche LEGO does not: parts are almost always from Sci-Fi licensed franchises like Gears of War and Halo, or historical and modern army weapons and equipment. So besides the cost of licensing themes, why is this an area not served by LEGO? What is the commonality of all the listings of this market? That’s right, <i>military</i> - and by extension - <i>violence</i>. These are the forbidden lands that LEGO has self-imposed exile from in order to maintain a family-friendly positioning accommodating to their original, younger target market, straying away from the dangerous political <i>(and maybe even social political)</i> waters. Goodbye BrickArms, it’s been nice knowing you.</p>

        <figcaption class="figcaption"><i>Admit it, we all wished for official military themed sets.</i></figcaption>
        </div>
        
        <div class="articleparagraphswrapper">
       <p>In the sidelines, LEGO also acquired a third-party brick manufacturer Sohobricks that manufactures only building blocks. I’m merely speculating, but this could be LEGO wanting to acquire the small-time manufacturer’s capabilities, or LEGO realizing that there are some niches the LEGO brand cannot serve, thus acquiring the firms that serve them. Or this could be the first step in LEGO slowly gobbling up all third-party manufacturers that undercut their prices and/or sell bricks in batches that they do not - slither.io style. Are you really buying bootlegged bricks if LEGO endorses the bootlegged bricks?</p>  
        
        <h4>Data</h4>
        
        <p>The possibilities of utilizing data are endless, but I see the acquisition of BrickLink opening LEGO up to a treasure trove of data on two fronts: the AFOL and specific brick pieces. Data on the AFOL will definitely give LEGO a relatively clearer picture of the specific demographic make-up of the adult market. LEGO could take it up a notch and segment this market further based on variables like age, geographic location, product-type choices, and the segments’ different interests for the personalization of market offerings. Personalization of LEGO themes according to different product-type choices of the adult market subsets is already in action: LEGO Technic and LEGO Architecture both appeal to two distinct subsets attracted to products centred upon functionality and practicality, and products centred upon aesthetics and display respectively.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="articleparagraphswrapper">
         <p>Access to data regarding specific brick pieces available on the marketplace allows LEGO to monitor the demand, pricing, and quantities available for specific pieces - LEGO could then include in-demand and scarce pieces (and more importantly minfigures) in future sets to make them more desirable; with these sets possibly sold at a premium. Overall, LEGO would now have quantitative, concrete data on which to base their strategic decisions regarding AFOLs moving forward.</p>
        
        <h4>Closing Thoughts and Predictions</h4>
        
        <p>The BrickLink community would be more involved in the operational functions of the marketplace, and would take a more active stance in holding LEGO accountable for what they say in the press release. That is why although LEGO could make changes at their own discretion, I believe the BrickLink community still has a say to some degree, and LEGO would have to stick to their light involvement. Ideally, LEGO would still have to cater to the whims of it’s adult fans, and only make changes that would sit well with them. But this is the corporate world so it’s hard to believe that would actually happen. LEGO might just become an Amazon of building blocks: being a manufacturer that competes with third-party sellers on a platform it also owns - building an unshakable monopoly empire fortified with impenetrable walls of bricks. </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;"><i>And we, the citizens of this systematically constructed kingdom of blocks, are powerless in our plastic inarticulate, tiny bodies to defy its power.</i></p>
